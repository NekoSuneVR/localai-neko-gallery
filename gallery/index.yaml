    Meta developed and released the Meta Llama 3 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and instruction tuned generative text models in 8 and 70B sizes. The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Further, in developing these models, we took great care to optimize helpfulness and safety.

    Variations Llama 3 comes in two sizes — 8B and 70B parameters — in pre-trained and instruction tuned variants.

    Input Models input text only.

    Output Models generate text and code only.

    Model Architecture Llama 3 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

        MPT-7B-Instruct is a model for short-form instruction following. It is built by finetuning MPT-7B on a dataset derived from the Databricks Dolly-15k and the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (HH-RLHF) datasets.
